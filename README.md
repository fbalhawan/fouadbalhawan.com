✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Overview
This is my playground, a place where I code with no rules, deadlines, or requirements. I have picked **Nx** as a build system to create a Monorepo that contains:

1. Personal portfolio and blog, written in **Next.js**

2. A content management system, using **Sanity**

3. A common **schemas** node module, written in TS. 

The project is deployed on **Vercel**.
